# C# OcrSudoku

Work in progress by Callum Hussey and Reuben Goetz-Wylie, latest versions can be found at
(https://github.com/calstr1/OcrSudoku).

The goal of this project is to result in an app (preferably mobile) that allows a user to
take a picture of a physical sudoku game, have it digitalised, and allow the user to play it
with the options to have hints, and be warned when making either a wrong or illegal move.

This is geared towards being a full stack project with a database storing users and sudokus,
and a fully interactive interface.

Versions:
0.2:  Add playability functionality.
0.1:  Solves Sudoku using human logic and reasoning.
